Hypothesis testing:
"past"/previous experiences: H0 - null hypothesis
"future"/alternatives: H2 alternate/research hypothesis

Usually we have:
	H0: theta = theta0
	H1: either one of the following: theta < theta0 (left-tailed test)
					 theta > theta0 (right-tailed test)
					 theta != theta0 (two tailed/bilateral test)'
Terminology:
alpha = significance level belongs (0,1), but in application: alpha belongs {0.05, 0.01, 0.001}
TS = test statistic
TS0 = TS(theta = theta0) = observed value of the test statistic (TS)
RR = rejection region
P-value = minimum threshold of rejection (smallest alpha we still reject H0)

How do we decide if we reject or do not H0
folosim numai reject/do not reject H0 fara accept sau altceva ca daca nu "bye-bye points" (nu stiu frate, ii ciudat profu asta)

Hypothesis testing: if (TS0 belongs RR) then reject H0
		    else do not reject H0

Significance testing (...)

VERY IMPORTANT:
Print clearly on the screen TS0, RR, P.

Sigma^2 - vartest
if you have 2 populations:
(sigma1)^2 / (sigma2)^2 - vartest2
