Confidence intervals

X - random variable / characteristic of a population
X has a probability density function (pdf) denoted by fX(x, theta)    [theta - unknown parameter to estimate as accurately as possible]

So the goal is to estimate theta.
Make a selection of volum n => Obtain X1,..., Xn selection variables
that are independent and identically distributed with X (i.e. X1, ..., Xn have the same pdf as X)

Methods:
1. Use a selection function.
theta_  (cu bara deasupra) = theta_  (X1, ..., Xn)

2. find thetaL_, thetaM_ (cu bara deasupra ambele) such that P(thetaL_ < theta < thetaM_) = 1 - alfa

Terminology:
1 - alpha = confidence level (coeff)
alpha = significance level 

Usually 0 <= 1 - alpha <= 1but we take values betw 0.95-0.99


x = vector of data / sample
n = sample size = length(x)
niu = population mean (theoretical mean)
x_ = sample mean ( mean(x) in Octave)
sigma^2 = population variance
s^2 = sample variance ( var(x) in Octave)
sigma = population standard deviation
s = sample standard deviation

Quantiles:
Zalpha = quantile of order alpha of the N(0,1)
