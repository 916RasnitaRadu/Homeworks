X = (		k		) , k = 0,n
	Cn * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

p = prob of success
k = nr of successes
n = nr of trials

pdf: f(x) = P(X = x)
cdf: F(x) = P(X <= x)

ex: binocdf, binopdf

As long as you are working with discrete probabilty laws, the pdf must be a graph of points and a cdf must be a stairway (to heaven) of functions.

Application:
A coin is tossed 3 times. 
Let X denote the number of heads that appear.
a) Find the probability distribution function of X. What type of distribution does X have?
b) Find the cumulative distribution function of X, FX.
c) Find P(X= 0) andP(X6= 1).
d) Find P(X≤2),P(X <2).
e) Find P(X≥1),P(X >1).
f) Write a Matlab code that simulates 3 coin tosses and computes the value of thevariable X.
